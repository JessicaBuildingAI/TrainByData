# TrainByData

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This AI analyzes your body composition data to identify physical weaknesses and potential. Based on your physiology, it creates optimized training plans, recommends targeted exercises, and suggests personalized supplementation for protein, creatine, and other key nutrients — helping you build your ideal body efficiently.

## Background

Many people struggle to train effectively and reach their fitness goals because they cannot precisely identify weaknesses in their routine or know how to improve them. Additionally, choosing the right supplements is confusing, and incorrect training or supplementation can be harmful to the body.
This is a widespread issue: millions of gym-goers and fitness enthusiasts worldwide face uncertainty in optimizing their workouts and nutrition for safe and efficient results.
I want to empower people to train smarter and more safely, maximizing results while minimizing risks. Helping individuals achieve their ideal physique in a scientifically-informed way motivates me personally.
Fitness and health are central to quality of life. A solution that combines AI-driven analysis, personalized workouts, and supplementation guidance has the potential to significantly improve training efficiency, safety, and overall well-being.

## How is it used?

Users simply upload their body analysis data from their gym or fitness tracker into the app, and the AI takes care of the rest. It analyzes weaknesses, recommends optimized workouts, and suggests personalized supplementation strategies to help users achieve their fitness goals efficiently.
The solution is ideal for use anytime users have access to body composition data, such as after a gym session, a fitness assessment, or at the start of a new training cycle. It is designed for environments where users want to optimize their training and nutrition but may lack expert guidance or time for research.
The primary users are fitness enthusiasts, gym-goers, and individuals with ambitious training goals. Key needs include personalized guidance, accurate identification of training weaknesses, safe and effective supplementation advice, and an easy-to-use, time-efficient interface.# TrainByData

## What next?

It would be great to get cooperations with Gyms that are doing bodychecks in their studios, so that potential users can actually work with it. 
Maybe users could profit even more from it, if the suggested supplement purchases can be bought directly in their studio and by using this app they get a discount.
